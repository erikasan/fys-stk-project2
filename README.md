# Classification and Regression, from linear and logistic regression to neural networks

This repository contains programs, test runs, material and report for project 2 in FYS-STK4155 made in collaboration between Oda Hovet (odasho), Ilse Kuperus (ilseku) and Erik Alexander Sandvik (erikasan).

## Structure

### Report folder
* Contains the PDF of the report

### Programs folder
